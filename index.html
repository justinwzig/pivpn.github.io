										<h2>PiVPN</h2>
										<p>Dead simple OpenVPN setup and configuration,<br>

                                    <ul class="feature-icons">
                                        <li class="fa-code"><strong></strong>INSTALLATION <br> curl -L https://install.pivpn.io | bash</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><b>SIMPLE: </b>It really is that simple -- assuming you have a functional Raspberry Pi, you can just run the line above in the console. More details on getting the RPi set up for this purpose can be found <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md">here</a>. SSH is also reccomended. <br> There is a (now slightly outdated) guided walkthrough of the install available <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/setting-up-a-home-vpn-using-your-raspberry-pi/">here,  if you're not familiar with Rasbian.</a>.<br>More information is also available on the <a href="https://github.com/pivpn/pivpn">PiVPN GitHub</a></p>
                                    <p><b>FLEXIBLE: </b>PiVPN allows you to customize your VPN port, certificate details, key encryption strength, client DNS server, and more! Even if you're a VPN veteran, the options presented within are a perfect foundation for any server installation.  Although this is geared toward running on a $35 Raspberry Pi, the installer will work just as well on an Ubuntu Server running Trusty Tahr 14.04 (and a bunch of other distros, too). </p>
                                    <p><b>MANAGEABLE: </b>Reconfiguration of PiVPN is available through the pivpn command. Easily add client profiles (OVPN), revoke them, list the ones you created, etc.  There is also an option to completely remove everything the installer did with the 'pivpn uninstall' command, so you can experiment with pivpn with no fear of irreversible changes to your server.</p>
                                    <p><b>SECURE: </b>Even though this installer makes everything so trivial, it doesn't mean it gives you trivial security settings.  Everything has been upgraded right out of the box beyond the default settings to harden the security of the server and client, starting with offering you the ability to enable unattended-upgrades which will automatically patch your server with security updates.  PiVPN uses only the latest TLS 1.2 protocol.  Both the data and control channels use upgraded AES and SHA256 encryption and hash algorithms. Options are pre-configured to verify your server certificate to battle MITM attack vectors.</p>

									<h3>About</h3>
                                <h5>Origin</h5>
                                <p>There are a variety of self-installing OpenVPN scripts, but this project in particular began with some code from <a href="https://github.com/StarshipEngineer/OpenVPN-Setup">StarshipEngineer</a>. However, even with the solid foundation provided by StarshipEngineer, the <a href="https://pi-hole.net">Pi-Hole</a> project inspired us to make installation even easier -- PiVPN is a combination of scripts from StarshipEngineer and Pi-Hole that fulfills this goal. Security protocols and configuration options were then added, and a few additions and tweaks help make managing the OpenVPN server even easier after install.</p>
                                <h5>Why This Is Important</h5>
                                <p>There are a few driving factors that make this very important to me and I believe the community at large.  In this post Snowden era where our privacy and security is infringed upon, not only by bad actors but potentially by those whom we thought should be protecting these very ideals, it is necessary for normal citizens to take matters into their own hands.  The trouble with this, many times, is that if you are not very technical you may not know how to begin.  I believe the EFF has helped lower a barrier of encrypted sites with their <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/certificate-authority-encrypt-entire-web">Let's Encrypt</a> initiative.  Allowing many to now have their sites on encrypted channels.  To me, the next logical step here is also ensuring the pipe you are using is as secure as possible.  This not only could include unknown networks at airports, Starbucks, generic public hot-spots; but also your ISP.  To that end I'd like to make sure these scripts also work on a Debian Jessie image from an Amazon free tier server.  It is important that more and more people have access to protecting their traffic online.  It's clear others won't hand you this protection.  PiVPN tries to make it easier for you to grab.  Enjoy!</p>

									<h3>Technical Information</h3>
                                    <p>OpenVPN is undergoing a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cryptography-expert-matthew-green-to-audit-openvpn-security/">security audit.</a>  In regards to PiVPN, this means that once OpenVPN 2.4 is released we will make every effort to have PiVPN use this version. This way we gain the security fixes that will come post audit. At that time we will also be able to use the better EC (elliptic curve) ciphers in creating certificates which should be more secure and also less taxing on clients. <br><br> For more information on PiVPN be sure to check the <a href="https://github.com/pivpn/pivpn/wiki">PiVPN Wiki</a> <br> It could also be helpful to browse closed Issues with the <a href="https://github.com/pivpn/pivpn/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Ainformation%20">Information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/pivpn/pivpn/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Aquestion%20">Question</a> tag. </p>
